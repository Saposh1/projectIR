def get_candidate_documents_and_scores(query_to_search, index, words, pls):
    """
    Generate a dictionary representing a pool of candidate documents for a given query. This function will go through every token in query_to_search
    and fetch the corresponding information (e.g., term frequency, document frequency, etc.') needed to calculate TF-IDF from the posting list.
    Then it will populate the dictionary 'candidates.'
    For calculation of IDF, use log with base 10.
    tf will be normalized based on the length of the document.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    query_to_search: list of tokens (str). This list will be preprocessed in advance (e.g., lower case, filtering stopwords, etc.').
                     Example: 'Hello, I love information retrival' --->  ['hello','love','information','retrieval']

    index:           inverted index loaded from the corresponding files.

    words,pls: iterator for working with posting.

    Returns:
    -----------
    dictionary of candidates. In the following format:
                                                               key: pair (doc_id,term)

def generate_query_tfidf_vector(query_to_search, index):
    """
    Generate a vector representing the query. Each entry within this vector represents a tfidf score.
    The terms representing the query will be the unique terms in the index.

    We will use tfidf on the query as well.
    For calculation of IDF, use log with base 10.
    tf will be normalized based on the length of the query.
